The flow of the user's journey begins at the home website, which includes various pages such as sports, placement, cultural activities, and a contact page for additional project information.

The user then proceeds to the required page to send an email to a specific faculty member regarding their absence from class, corresponding to their respective course.

Initially, the user must create an account by providing their details and using their college email address. An OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to the user's email for verification. Once the OTP is entered, the user's identity is confirmed, and they are directed to the sign-up page where they can enter their email and password.

To ensure password security, the system stores passwords in a hashed format, making it impossible to decrypt. After completing all the necessary verifications, the user proceeds to the attendance page.

On the attendance page, the user enters the course ID to retrieve comprehensive information about the course, including the faculty's email address. The user copies the email and proceeds to the next page.

At this stage, the user enters the copied email along with other required details and sends the email to the faculty using their college email ID. After sending the email, the user can choose to log out or return to the home page, thus completing the entire cycle.
